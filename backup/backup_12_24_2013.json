\nSubmitted by Catherine Gilbert Wheatland Historical Association \n\nThe following news article was in the Caledonia Advertiser in 1947   \n \nThe  Village  of  Scottsville  paid  tribute  to    the  servicemen  of  the  community    who  gave  their  lives  in  three \nwars  in the dedication of a memorial  in the Scottsville Free Library Wednesday October 29 1947 The memo-\nrial  oaken  panel  spanning  the  entire  north  wall  of  the Main  room  of  the  building    was  lettered  with  the  names \nof local men who served in wars from the Revolution to World War  II  Thirty - five men died in the Civil War \ntwo  in World War  I and nine  in World   War  II   The architect of  the beautiful memorial was Mr Carl Schmidt \nand the inspiring quotations were chosen by Dr Alfred H Jones \n \nApproximately one hundred and twenty - five  persons   were   present to  enjoy the impressive dedication pro-\ngram    The  Rev  Edward  Hartman  presented  the  invocation  Colonel  Carey  Brown  Principal  speaker  delivered \nan outstanding address   in which he said  This memorial  is a fitting reminder to us of those who gave the most \nand  risked  the  most  so  that  we  should  continue  to  enjoy  the  American  privileges  typified  by  Scottsville \nlife   The set of automatic chimes also part of the memorial and gift to the village played America during the \ndedication rites \n  \nThe  memorial  was  generously  donated  to  the  Village  by  local  philanthropist  RT  Miller  and  still  stands  on  the \nnorth  wall  of  the  stage  area  in  the  library  today  Many  names  have  been  added  to  the  list  of  men  and  women \nwho have served  in conflicts since  its original dedication   On Memorial Day the parade comes to a halt  in front \nof  the  library while  a member  of  the Boy  or Girl  Scouts  and  an American Legion  representative  lay  a wreath  at \nthe wall in tribute to these servicemen and women \n  \nVisitors to the library are awed by this large wall and its list of names that tell a story of the soldiers in our com-\nmunitys history  Have you visited this memorial wall lately \n\nPeruvian Project 5-K Run  Help the Cause

Im really looking  \nPhoto of M Souers \nforward to getting back in the garden \nIn the Fall NewsletterI talked of a funding source that may help the Village address our  \nneed  to  repair  or  replace  the  aging Waste Water Treatment  Plant Our  application  to  the Rural Develop-\nment Agency for replacing the plant with a Pump Station was approved as a  low  interest  loan  for the  life of \nthe project  (38 years) We also have two separate grant applications  in process at this time We now have \nan  opportunity  to  retire  our  aging Waste Water  Treatment  Plant  and  build  a  Pump  Station  connecting  to \nthe  Monroe  County  Pure Waters  system  for  considerably  less  than  upgrading  the  existing  plant  to  meet \ncurrent standards and  future needs This cost would be spread equally  to all users over  the  life of  the pro-\nject  There  are  other  benefits  to  our  community  as  a  whole  besides  the  long  term  cost  advantage  This \nproject  is  being  built  to  allow  for  moderate  growth  in  the  Town  which  will  in  turn  help  expand  the  tax \nbase  and  hopefully  help  increase  our  student  enrollment  in  the  Wheatland-Chili  School  district  keeping \nthose  jobs  in  our  community  and  that  buying  power  local  Decommissioning  a  plant  already  over  its  life \nexpectancy  and  situated  on  our  Class  A  trout  stream  (Oatka  Creek)  has  an  environmental  benefit  as \nwell as economic development advantages  \nOur next step is to present facts and figures to you first in a letter mailed out later this month then in a \nseries of Public Informational meetings  I would hope to see the first of these meetings in May \nI  also  want  to  say  that  on  April  1st  the  Village Clerk  Elaine  Driscoll  will  swear  in  a  new Mayor  and  two \nnew Trustees We all need to thank retiring Trustees Rick VenVertloh and Lino Contestibile for their dedi-\ncation  and  outstanding  service  to  our  Village  Please  welcome  support  and  engage  the  new  Trustees  and \nMayor  \nIn closing I want to say how much Ive enjoyed working with everyone in Scottsville  We really do live in a \ngreat  small  town  that  knows  how  to  pull  together  when  necessary  and  yes  let  its  elected  officials  know \nhow  things may be  improved This  is what American Democracy  is all about Here at  the grass  roots  level \nwe  tackle  problems  discuss  alternatives  and  act  on  whats  best  for  the  community  as  a  whole  I  am  so \nproud to have been the Mayor here in our diverse population which works together for the greater good \n \nWith Sincere Thanks Michael Souers \n\n \n\nA Look Back As Smith Warren American Legion Celebrates Its 90th Birthday \n\nThe  following  excerpts  are  from  Short History of Smith-Warren Post #367 Scottsville NY    written  by  Jack  Oblien  and \nhave been edited to fit this newsletter (Thanks Jack) \nThe first meeting to organize Smith-Warren Post was held some time in 1919 The driving force behind the forma-\ntion was Robert  J Murphy The Post was granted a Charter on September 8 1919 and  is one of  the 5 oldest Posts \nin  the  County  The  Post  was  named  after Warren  N  Smith  and  his  cousin William  J Warren Warren  and  Smith \nwere members of the 78th Division 310th Infantry   \nThe Post at sometime started to meet in the basement of the Oatka Hotel which at that time was owned by a Mr \nWoodard There  is  a  story  about  one  of  the meetings  held  at  the  hotel  -  John  Leonard  Sr  credited  for  originating \nthe Turkey Raffle held the first raffle at the Oatka Hotel and  in those days before freezers  live turkeys were used \nAfter  one  of  the meetings  the members  played  a  game  of  cards  and  they  started  getting mellow  Someone whose \nname  has  been  lost  liberated  the  turkeys  The  story  goes  that  many  a  bottle  glass  and  dish  were  overturned  or \nbroken in pursuit of the running birds  \nOn  a  Saturday  in  June  1958  the  Post  was  host  to  the Monroe  County  convention What  is  remembered most  by \nthe  legionnaires  that  were  in  attendance  was  the  Mayor  of  Scottsville  Albert  Carver  The  Mayor  in  a  moment  of \nexuberance  stated  to  the  convention  that he would donate $100  to  the Post  for every delegate  in  attendance His \nexuberance  being  noted  and  afraid  that  it might  subside  Jim Cameron  took  him  home  to  get  his  check  book  and \nbrought a $50000 check back to the Post The check was promptly cashed Monday morning  in case he changed his \nmind  \n\nJulie A Kuhn  \nElaine M Driscoll  \nScottsville Village Clerks Office \nDeputy Clerk \nVillage Clerk \n2010 Tax Collection - 2010 Village Tax bills

Rescue  Squad  has  taken  de-\nlivery  of  a  new  ambulance    The  ambulance  was  custom  built  for  the \nRescue Squad by Braun  Industries on a 2010 Ford chassis  The design \nwas  a  collaboration  between  members  of  the  Rescue  Squad  various \nvendors and  safety experts and overseen by Rescue Squad Chief Matt \nJarrett   \n \nThe  custom  design  of  the  patient  compartment  was  built  with  a  pri-\nmary focus on safety for both the patient and EMS workers and incor-\nporates sliding seats with a restraint system to prevent an EMS worker \nfrom  being  thrown  about  and  against  hard  sharp  objects  found  inside \nan  ambulance  Traditional  ambulance  design  offers  little  opportunity \nfor  EMS  workers  to  remain  restrained  while  treating  a  patient  since \nthe  layout usually wont allow a belted worker  to  reach  the patient or \ncritical equipment while wearing a lap seatbelt Jarrett said \n \nThis ambulance will replace the ambulance that was purchased in 1996  \nIt  is expected  to be  in service  in  late April and has a  life expectancy of \n15 to 16 years \n \nCPR  and  AED  TRAINING  -  If  a  family  member  or  close  friend \nwent  into  cardiac  arrest  in  your  presence  would  you  be  able  to  help \nthem  by  administering  Cardio  Pulmonary  Resuscitation  (CPR)  Re-\nsearch  shows  that  heart  attack  victims  have  double  the  chance of  sur-\nvival  if  they  are  immediately  given  CPR  Unfortunately  most  Ameri-\ncans  are  not  trained  in  this  simple  but  crucial  life-saving  skill  although \n70% to 80% of cardiac arrest emergencies happen in the home   \n \nWhen  a  person  goes  into  sudden  cardiac  arrest  the  heart  brain  and \nScottsville Rotary Diana Balch
